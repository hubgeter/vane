# Release process

Vane releases are immutable source and binary artifacts derived from one
reviewed commit on `main`. The GitHub Release body is the canonical public
record of user-visible changes; the repository does not maintain a rolling
changelog or a release-notes template.

## Release invariants

- The package version is a valid, previously unused PEP 440 version. Its tag is
  exactly `v<version>` and points to the reviewed commit tested for release.
- One workflow run builds the sdist and all wheels once. The exact same files
  are promoted through TestPyPI, PyPI, and the GitHub Release.
- A GitHub Release remains a draft until PyPI publication succeeds and all
  checksums, signatures, the SBOM, and provenance are attached.
- A release tag cannot be updated or deleted from the moment it is created,
  including while its GitHub Release is still a draft. Published releases and
  artifacts are never replaced. A bad release is superseded by a new version
  and yanked when necessary.

## One-time repository configuration

Repository administrators must:

1. Keep `main` as the default branch and protect it with pull-request review,
   required CI and code-quality checks, resolved conversations, and deletion
   and non-fast-forward update protection.
2. Create an active tag ruleset with no bypass actors for `refs/tags/v*`. Allow
   initial tag creation, but restrict deletion and block force pushes so the
   tag cannot move between workflow dispatch and publication. GitHub immutable
   releases provide an additional lock only after the draft is published.
3. Enable private vulnerability reporting, the dependency graph, Dependabot
   alerts and security updates, secret scanning with push protection, and code
   scanning.
4. Configure the `RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CONTENT_RULES` repository secret used by
   trusted artifact validation.
5. Create protected `testpypi` and `pypi` GitHub environments. Both accept only
   `v*` tags, require maintainer approval, and disallow administrator bypass.
6. Register `.github/workflows/release.yml` as a trusted publisher for the
   `vane-ai` project on TestPyPI and PyPI, using the matching `testpypi` and
   `pypi` environment names. Publishing intentionally has no API-token fallback.
7. After the draft-first workflow has passed a build-only dry run, enable
   GitHub immutable releases. Draft releases must remain mutable so the
   workflow can attach their assets before publication.

Review these settings before every release rather than assuming the one-time
configuration has remained unchanged.

## Prepare the release pull request

1. Set the final PEP 440 version in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Put the complete proposed GitHub Release notes in the pull-request
   description. Reviewers approve those notes together with the code; do not
   depend on an unreviewed local notes file.
3. Record the exact `external/duckdb` tree ID reported by
   `python scripts/sync_duckdb_source_id.py --print` and the full fork revision
   reported by
   `python scripts/resolve_duckdb_fork_version.py --print-revision` in the pull
   request. Update `DUCKDB_UPSTREAM_VERSION` and `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md` only
   when the imported upstream baseline, DuckDB version line, or historical
   mapping changes.
4. Confirm that `cmake/lance_extension_config.cmake` pins the reviewed
   lance-duckdb commit and that the remote commit is still retrievable. Release
   builds must use that immutable source instead of a local
   `DUCKDB_LANCE_DIRECTORY` override.
5. Confirm that imported dependencies have compatible terms and that
   `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY.md`, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE` are current.
6. Install the pinned vcpkg manifest, run
   `python scripts/sync_vcpkg_licenses.py --check`, and verify the Lance Rust
   bundle against the fetched source with
   `python scripts/sync_lance_cargo_licenses.py --check`.
7. Run formatting, fast and release tests, relevant slow and native tests, and
   the build-only release workflow. Manually inspect the sdist and wheel file
   lists. TPC-H, TPC-DS, TPC-E tools, local paths, credentials, caches, logs,
   model weights, and build directories must not be present.
8. Triage security findings. A release must not carry an unexplained
   first-party critical or high-severity alert. Record the disposition of
   inherited and third-party findings that affect shipped code.
9. Confirm that the version is absent from both TestPyPI and PyPI, review known
   issues and the supported-platform statement, merge the pull request, and
   record its exact commit SHA.

Run a build-only dry run from the reviewed commit with:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  --repo AstroVela/vane \
  --ref main \
  -f operation=build-only
```

## Create the tag and draft release

1. Confirm the recorded release commit is reachable from `main` and has not
   changed since the release pull request passed its gates.
2. Confirm the active `v*` tag ruleset restricts deletion and force pushes and
   has no bypass actors. Create and push the exact `v<version>` tag at the
   recorded commit, then verify that the remote tag resolves to that commit.
   Never create the tag from an unreviewed working tree.
3. Create a draft GitHub Release for the protected tag. Copy the approved notes
   into its body without changing their meaning, and mark alpha, beta, and
   release-candidate versions as prereleases.
4. Manually dispatch the Release workflow using that tag as the workflow ref
   and `operation=release`.

The workflow rejects a release operation unless the selected ref is the
matching version tag, the tagged commit is reachable from `main`, the GitHub
Release exists and is still a draft, and the version is absent from both
package indexes.

## Build, stage, and publish

Release automation must:

- build the sdist first, letting the PEP 517 backend inject
  `DUCKDB_SOURCE_ID` and `DUCKDB_FORK_REVISION`;
- validate it with `scripts/check_release_artifacts.py` and the private content
  rules;
- build all manylinux wheels from that exact sdist in clean environments;
- validate wheel metadata, contents, `RECORD`, license files, and coexistence
  with the official DuckDB package;
- install each wheel in a fresh environment and run the Quickstart smoke test;
- generate SHA-256 checksums, a CycloneDX SBOM, GitHub build provenance, and
  Sigstore signatures;
- publish those distributions to TestPyPI through its protected environment;
- install the indexed candidate in a clean job without a source checkout and
  run the public smoke test;
- wait for explicit approval on the protected `pypi` environment;
- publish the same distributions to PyPI, attach all artifacts to the draft
  GitHub Release, and only then publish the draft.

Do not approve the `pypi` environment until the automated TestPyPI job has
passed and a maintainer has independently installed the exact version in a
clean machine, run the public Quickstart, reviewed artifact contents, and
recorded approval according to `GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Verify the public release

After publication:

1. Install `vane-ai==<version>` from PyPI without access to the source checkout
   and run the Quickstart.
2. Download the GitHub Release assets, run `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`, and confirm
   the PyPI files have the same hashes.
3. Verify build provenance for every distribution:

   ```bash
   gh attestation verify <distribution> --repo AstroVela/vane
   ```

4. Confirm the GitHub Release is immutable, the tag points to the recorded
   release commit, PyPI metadata and provenance are correct, and public
   documentation links resolve.
5. Announce material known issues and security limitations, and retain the
   workflow run, approvals, checksums, provenance, and review record for audit.

## Respond to a bad release

If a problem is found before the release tag is created, cancel the workflow
and correct the release pull request. Once a `v*` tag exists, do not move,
delete, or reuse it even if neither package index has received the version;
abandon the draft and supersede it with a new version and tag. For a harmful
PyPI release, yank it, publish a fixed version, and add a clear notice to the
affected GitHub Release. Use the security-advisory process when confidentiality
or coordinated disclosure is required.
