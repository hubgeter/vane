Vane unifies multimodal data, intelligence, and continuous learning with Python and SQL interfaces, seamlessly scaling from local environments to Ray clusters.

![Vane platform overview](assets/vane-platform.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Project status**
>
> - **Vane Data** — Supports most of the capabilities described below and is under active development, but is **not yet production-ready**. Its interfaces and internals may continue to evolve as the codebase is reviewed and hardened.
> - **Vane RL** and **Vane Agent** — In the early stages of design and implementation. Their source code will be released in future updates.
  - **Vibe Coding and Agentic Engineering** — Some parts of our system were initially built through Vibe Coding. We are now continuously analyzing, understanding, and improving the codebase, applying an Agentic Engineering approach to drive iterative optimization and enhance the quality, maintainability, and efficiency of the system.

## Vane Data

Vane Data is a high-performance, multimodal-native data engine for AI workloads. Built on a fork of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), it extends the core execution engine with native multimodal processing and a unified framework for local and distributed execution.

### Key Features

- **Multimodal-native processing** — Process images, video, audio, text, documents, events, sensor data, and tables through a unified type system. Dynamic batching and backpressure control handle variations in data size and computational cost.
- **Python and SQL interfaces** — Build data and AI pipelines with DuckDB SQL or the Python Relation API.
- **Built-in AI operations** — Invoke LLMs, generate embeddings, and run batch inference through OpenAI and Anthropic APIs or native vLLM integration. Prefix-aware bucketing improves vLLM prefix-cache hit rates and inference throughput.
- **Heterogeneous execution** — Overlap CPU, GPU, I/O, and model inference workloads through asynchronous scheduling.
- **Local-to-cloud execution** — Run the same pipeline locally or across distributed Ray clusters, with a foundation for future edge-cloud coordination.
- **Designed for production AI workloads** — Build multimodal training-data preprocessing pipelines and enterprise-scale batch inference workflows.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Vane supports Python 3.10 through 3.14. Python 3.12 is recommended and is the primary development version.

Install the `vane-ai` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install vane-ai
```

Vane owns only the `vane` Python namespace. It does not install `duckdb`,
`_duckdb`, or `adbc_driver_duckdb`, so the official `duckdb` distribution can
be installed in the same environment and both engines can be imported in the
same process. Vane code must use `import vane`; `import duckdb` always refers
to the separately installed official package. Vane does not provide a legacy
`duckdb` alias or fall back to an official DuckDB native module.

```python
import duckdb
import vane

assert vane.connect().execute("SELECT 42").fetchone() == (42,)
assert duckdb.connect().execute("SELECT 43").fetchone() == (43,)
```

Vane's ADBC driver is exposed as `vane.adbc`; the official driver's
`adbc_driver_duckdb` namespace remains owned by the official distribution.
Install `adbc-driver-manager` (also included by `vane-ai[all]`) to use either
ADBC facade.

Optional features are provided as extras:

```bash
pip install 'vane-ai[openai]'   # OpenAI provider (anthropic / google / transformers / vllm likewise)
pip install 'vane-ai[image]'    # ndarray image inputs for AI providers (Pillow)
pip install 'vane-ai[video]'    # video data source (Pillow, psutil, decord)
```

The `video` extra installs `decord` on Linux x86-64, Vane's currently supported native platform. decord itself publishes no wheels for modern Python on macOS or for any ARM platform; if Vane adds Windows support later, decord's existing `win_amd64` wheel can be enabled explicitly.

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](https://vane.astrovela.ai/docs/data/quickstart/installation).

### Quick Start

Follow the [Quickstart guide](https://vane.astrovela.ai/docs/data/quickstart/quickstart) to build and run your first Vane pipeline.

### Execution Policy

Vane uses the Ray runner by default. If no runner is configured, executing a lazy relation through consumers such as
display, result fetching, or file writes selects Ray and may lazily initialize it. An experimental local runner can be
selected explicitly before creating connections:

```python
import vane

vane.configure(runner="local")
```

### Lance datasets

Vane statically links a pinned revision of [`lance-duckdb`](https://github.com/hubgeter/lance-duckdb); applications do
not need to `INSTALL` or `LOAD` an extension. Lance datasets can be read and written through either SQL or the Python
Relation API:

See [the complete Vane + Lance guide](LANCE.md) for executable local, Ray, S3/MinIO, secrets, directory namespace,
and REST namespace examples, together with an explicit validation matrix. The
[integration and concurrency architecture](VANE_LANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the implementation changes and its
thread, process, and multi-node execution boundaries.

```python
import vane
from vane.lance import LanceDataset

con = vane.connect()
source = con.read_parquet("s3://example-bucket/input/*.parquet")
source.write_lance("s3://example-bucket/datasets/items.lance", mode="create")

dataset = LanceDataset("s3://example-bucket/datasets/items.lance", con)
rows = dataset.scan().filter("score >= 0.9")
nearest = dataset.vector_search("embedding", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], k=10)
```

```sql
COPY (SELECT 1::BIGINT AS id, 'one'::VARCHAR AS label)
TO '/mnt/shared/items.lance' (FORMAT LANCE, MODE 'create');

COPY (SELECT 2::BIGINT AS id, 'two'::VARCHAR AS label)
TO '/mnt/shared/items.lance' (FORMAT LANCE, MODE 'append');

SELECT * FROM '/mnt/shared/items.lance';
```

With the Ray runner, ordinary scans are split by immutable Lance fragments. Vector, full-text, and hybrid searches run
as one global task so ranking remains correct. Distributed `create`, `append`, and `overwrite` writes produce
uncommitted staging transactions on workers; the driver-side commit owner validates all selected task results and
publishes one Lance transaction. Operation identities make a retried final commit idempotent. Known pre-commit failures
remove their staging and uncommitted destination files; outcome-unknown writes retain evidence for reconciliation. Empty
inputs still create a zero-row dataset with the input schema.

Distributed append currently requires an exact Lance schema match, including field identities and metadata. Plain
local paths are normalized to absolute paths when the query is bound, but that path must name the same shared
filesystem on every Ray node. For multi-node deployments, prefer S3 or an S3-compatible store and provide credentials
through a scoped `TYPE LANCE` secret instead of URI query parameters or user information. Directory and REST namespace
catalog operations, DDL, index maintenance, optimization, and vacuum run on the driver. Vane coordinates
public-helper mutations within one local process or Ray control plane; independent processes, clusters, and external
writers remain subject to Lance's own commit-conflict rules.

### Distributed Flight Transport

Vane follows [Ray's trusted-cluster model](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-security/index.html): the driver, workers, submitted code, and east-west network belong to one trusted computing boundary. Same-process local-disk shuffle reads directly from the process-local registry, and object-storage shuffle reads committed manifests. Only cross-worker local-disk shuffle uses Arrow Flight.

A worker lazily starts one process-owned plaintext `grpc://` Flight service when a local-disk exchange sink first needs it. The service provides no TLS, client authentication, query-level authorization, or tenant isolation. Keep its port reachable only inside the controlled Ray cluster network; workloads that do not trust one another require separate isolated Ray clusters.

Workers advertise their Ray private address by default. `VANE_FLIGHT_BIND_HOST` may select a different local bind address, including `0.0.0.0` in a container with appropriate network policy, while `VANE_FLIGHT_ADVERTISE_HOST` must always be a routable non-wildcard address. The advertised-host override is worker-local: set it in each worker node's environment rather than on the driver or in a Ray Job/actor runtime environment. `DUCKDB_FLIGHT_PORT` selects a fixed worker-local port; the default `0` lets the operating system allocate one. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the complete trust boundary.

Cross-worker reads have a one-hour call deadline and a 60-second maximum duration for each blocking DoGet, schema, or batch-read operation by default. Override them with `VANE_FLIGHT_CALL_TIMEOUT_S` and `VANE_FLIGHT_READ_TIMEOUT_S`; either value may be set to `0` to disable that timeout. The read timeout measures the complete Arrow operation, not byte-level network idleness. Query interruption also cancels an in-flight Flight call, so stalled consumers release the producer-side stream and its shuffle-file read lease.

## Multimodal Inference Benchmarks

Hardware configuration: 1 node, 36 CPU cores, 64 GB memory, and 1× NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (22 GB VRAM).

We use the [Ray Data benchmark suite](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/ray-data-daft-benchmarking-multimodal-ai-workloads) to compare Vane with Ray Data and Daft. The [benchmark source code](multimodal_inference_benchmarks) is included in this repository.

![Multimodal inference benchmark comparing Vane Data, Ray Data, and Daft](assets/benchmark.png)

The Ray runner targets distributed workloads. The current results are single-node only; validation on the multi-node environments used in the Ray Data benchmarks is still pending.

See the [benchmarking page](https://vane.astrovela.ai/benchmarks) for detailed results.
