# Source provenance

Vane is an independent project. New contributions made directly to this repository are accepted under the Apache License, Version 2.0, unless a file or directory says otherwise.

The repository also contains substantial code derived from projects with compatible licenses. Those original license and attribution requirements remain in force.

| Area | Origin | License treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vane-specific code under `vane/` and distributed execution changes | Vane contributors | Apache-2.0 by default |
| `external/duckdb/` | `duckdb/duckdb` plus Vane-maintained engine customizations | DuckDB MIT license plus the licenses retained in its vendored directories |
| Build-fetched `lance-duckdb` | `hubgeter/lance-duckdb` commit `856203ca15bdf21e1f6c2962038ccbd4598573b0`, based on `AstroVela/lance-duckdb` commit `63c2446f7d9c8a59fd73a49fededb0c3725cc192` | Apache-2.0; the immutable revision is declared in `cmake/lance_extension_config.cmake` |
| DuckDB-derived modules and stubs moved under `vane/`, plus `src/vane_py/` | Derived from DuckDB's Python client and subsequently modified for Vane | Original DuckDB portions remain MIT; Vane contributions are Apache-2.0 |
| Tests and benchmarks derived from DuckDB or other named suites | Their named upstream source | License noted in the source directory or `THIRD_PARTY.md` |

## File-level license markers

New Vane source files use an `Apache-2.0` SPDX identifier. Parent-repository files that combine inherited DuckDB or DuckDB Python client source with Vane modifications use `MIT AND Apache-2.0` and retain both copyright notices. New and modified source in `external/duckdb` remains under that repository's MIT license.

Existing third-party headers are preserved. Unchanged upstream source, vendored dependencies, and generated output are not mechanically relabeled. Run `python3 scripts/check_source_license_headers.py` from the repository root to validate the applicable files.

The Lance SQL extension is maintained independently at
`https://github.com/hubgeter/lance-duckdb` and fetched by CMake at immutable
revision `856203ca15bdf21e1f6c2962038ccbd4598573b0`. It is not copied into Vane and
is not a Git submodule. That revision contains the Vane distributed scan and
write adapters on top of `AstroVela/lance-duckdb` revision
`63c2446f7d9c8a59fd73a49fededb0c3725cc192`. The Vane-only revision removes
the upstream `duckdb` and `extension-ci-tools` gitlinks entirely; the extension
is compiled directly against Vane's `external/duckdb` and only its static target
is linked into `vane._native`. `DUCKDB_LANCE_DIRECTORY` may select a local
checkout for offline or coordinated development, but release builds use the
declared immutable Git source.

The fork keeps the upstream cloud feature set. Its separate parent commit
`f83fa8cac403ee8c05e627bfc159380e04a2f36a` regenerates the stale upstream lock
file: the upstream manifest requires Lance 9 and DataFusion 54 while the
checked-in lock still resolved Lance 8 and DataFusion 53. That lock refresh
does not patch crate source and deliberately retains the upstream `quick-xml`
versions documented in `SECURITY.md`.

The DuckDB engine is imported under `external/duckdb` as a squashed Git subtree
from `https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb.git`. Subtree metadata records the exact
official upstream revision, while DuckDB's original history remains in its
upstream repository rather than becoming an ancestor of Vane's main branch.
The current official upstream baseline is commit
`3a3967aa8190d0a2d1931d4ca4f5d920760030b4`.

Vane's engine customizations are retained as normal commits after that subtree
snapshot. The former `AstroVela/duckdb` history maps to Vane as follows:

| Former fork commit | Parent | Corresponding Vane commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `398033a962719ac09868f4484ec4f97353bb0325` | `3a3967aa8190d0a2d1931d4ca4f5d920760030b4` | `57d4e3c166e307c19b28cb1bb2ea7ebd2283a030` |
| `e2d398989076fa3c6c3859e77310e5e50608b168` | `398033a962719ac09868f4484ec4f97353bb0325` | `74f8d91976c69d8861262944eb61f4b8a05abd42` |

The former fork is not used for builds or engine identity. Vane intentionally
does not retain a bundle or other archive of its Git objects. The identifiers
above are kept only as a historical mapping; maintained customization history
is the corresponding Vane commits, and the official baseline history remains
in `duckdb/duckdb`. The former fork may therefore be deleted without an
archival prerequisite.

At Vane commit `74f8d91976c69d8861262944eb61f4b8a05abd42`, the
DuckDB-rooted subtree history is described as `v1.5.0-2-g55abe0cb9e`. That
description is retained only as historical provenance and is no longer used as
the runtime version.

Vane records the reviewed official release line in
`DUCKDB_UPSTREAM_VERSION`. The build combines that value with the first ten
characters of the last Vane commit that changed `external/duckdb`, as resolved
by `git rev-list -1 HEAD -- external/duckdb`. DuckDB therefore reports a
user-facing version such as `v1.5.0-vane.594c360bbc`, without a manually
maintained counter or `g` prefix. Uncommitted engine changes append `-dirty`;
uncommitted changes outside the engine do not affect this version. Incremental
builds refresh a generated version header, so both dirty-state transitions and
new engine commits are reflected without manually editing build metadata.

The exact engine identity remains content-derived. The build computes the full
Git tree object for `external/duckdb` with
`scripts/sync_duckdb_source_id.py`. Git builds write the short identity only to
a generated header in the CMake binary directory. The external tree is a CMake
configuration dependency, so direct Ninja and Makefile builds refresh
configure-time metadata after timestamp-visible source changes. The version
object and default in-tree static extension entry points force-include the
applicable generated headers, keeping runtime identities consistent on the
first build even for mode-only changes that leave timestamps untouched. Vane
fork versions are treated as development identities for extension lookup, so
extension compatibility continues to use the SourceID rather than the
human-readable fork commit.

When Git metadata and a source-distribution manifest are absent, the SourceID
script derives the same Git-compatible object encoding from the materialized
tree. The constant `.git_archival.txt` export template records whether that
encoding uses SHA-1 or SHA-256 without introducing a generated identity file
that changes in normal commits. A commit identity cannot be reconstructed from
files alone, so the PEP 517 backend injects both the full `DUCKDB_SOURCE_ID` and
the full `DUCKDB_FORK_REVISION` into source distributions without modifying the
checkout. Subsequent builds without Git metadata require the injected fork
revision and retain both identities. The tree object depends on engine paths,
modes, symlinks, and contents rather than commit topology, while the fork
revision intentionally records Vane history; rebases and squash merges can
therefore change the displayed revision without changing the SourceID.

Ordinary engine changes require no tracked identity update. Changes to the
upstream baseline, DuckDB version line, or historical mapping must update this
document and `DUCKDB_UPSTREAM_VERSION`. Release reviews must record the full
fork revision and tree ID and inspect subsequent Vane engine commits since the
previously released state.

The statically linked DuckDB HTTPFS extension is fetched separately during the
native build and pinned to commit
`74f954001f3a740c909181b02259de6c7b942632` by
`external/duckdb/.github/config/extensions/httpfs.cmake`. It is covered by the
DuckDB MIT license recorded in `LICENSES/DuckDB-MIT.txt`.

The imported DuckDB tree contains upstream benchmark generators with additional terms, including TPC-H, TPC-DS, and TPC-E material. They are not part of Vane release artifacts. The sdist allowlist and artifact checker enforce this boundary.

When importing code:

1. Record the upstream repository, immutable revision, and source path in the pull request.
2. Confirm that its license is compatible with distribution in this repository.
3. Preserve required copyright, license, modification, and NOTICE text.
4. Update `THIRD_PARTY.md`, the relevant file headers, and the release artifact license bundle.

Do not add or mechanically replace license headers across inherited files without first identifying their provenance.
